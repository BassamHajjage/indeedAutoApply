# Indeed Auto Apply

## About this project

Welcome to my first Chrome extension - and also one of my first major open-source projects.

Because many recruiters, hiring managers, and bots will just automatically deny your application for what appears to be arbitrary reasons without giving you any feedback whatsoever as to WHY your application was denied, we have an inherent need to fight back and to make the process as easy as possible for us.

Breaking into a career in tech has proven to be a pure numbers game, so let's get those numbers boosted with the powers of ✨automation✨
